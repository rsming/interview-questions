== benefits ==

  - orchestrate containers
  - zero-downtime deployment
  - self healing
  - scale containers

== building blocks ==

image::./k8s-building-blocks.png[]

  - deployment (provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets)
  - replicaSet (A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods)
  - pod
  - service (single point of entry to access one or more pods) IP address is reliable
  - storage

== services ==

  - ClusterIP - for inner claster communications (invisible outside the cluster without `port fowarding`)
  - NodePort - expose the service
  - LoadBalancer - expose the service ans act as a load balancer
  - ExternalName - maps service (proxy to external service) to DNS name

== storage ==

  - Ephemeral storage (emptyDir) has lifetime of the pod
  - Persistent storage (third party / cloud / ...)
  - PersistentVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims and StorageClasses
  - ConfigMaps (key/value pairs)
  - Secrets

== k8s web ui (dashboard) ==

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/

  - `kubectl apply [dashboard-yaml-url]`
  - `kubectl describe secret -n kube-system`
  - locate the kubernetes.io/service-account-tocken and copy the tocken
  - `kubectl proxy`
  - visit the dashboard url and login using the token
