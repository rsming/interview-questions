## Sorting algorytms

| ALGORYTHM | IDEA | COMPLEXITY | ADVANTAGE / DRAWBACK |
| :-------- | :--- | :--------: | :------------------- |
| Mergesort | The sorting algorithm produces a sorted sequence by sorting its two halves and merging them. | O(n log(n)) | It needs an additional space of Θ(n) for the temporary array b. |
| Shellsort | Arrange the data sequence in a two-dimensional array and sort the columns of the array. | O(n·log(n))2 | |
| Heapsort  | The data structure of the heapsort algorithm is a heap. | O(n·log(n)) | Heapsort is not stable. A sorting algorithm is stable, if it leaves the order of equal elements unchanged.|
